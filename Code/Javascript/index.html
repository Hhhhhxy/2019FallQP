         Considering that UCSD is already a large 
         campus with more and more students beingenrolled every year, it is no wonder that students
         are consistently finding major study/diningspots such as the library and price center crowded.
          This situation is difficult to avoid since it ishard to tell whether a location is crowded or not
           in real-time unless the student is present at thelocation. In order to address this issue, our team 
           decided to create a product that can help achievethis function in order to improve the day to day 
           lives of students at UCSD.Our product is a real-time population tracker that determines the number 
           of students at alocation through the use of sensors. The product consists of a Raspberry Pi which 
           serves as acontrol-center and ultrasonic sensors that are logically programmed to determine the 
           number ofpeople going into and coming out of a designated location at a certain time.</font>

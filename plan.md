1. Seat count in PC. 
  
i) Description: 
  Price Center is becoming overcrowded recently. It will be perfect if we can measure the empty seat count in each section of PC. The idea is using human body detect technology to measure if the table is occupied. We can put camara in  
different section of Price Center. Try to count the empty table at real time, then calculate the remaining seat, etc.

ii) What do we need:
  a) 3 or 4 cameras.

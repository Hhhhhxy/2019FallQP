Helloworld!

This is just the plan for the proposal.

1. Seat count in PC. 
  
i) Description: 
  Price Center is becoming overcrowded recently. It will be perfect if we can measure the empty seat count in each section of PC. The idea is using human body detect technology to measure if the table is occupied. We can put camara in different section of Price Center. Try to count the empty table at real time, then calculate the remaining seat, etc.

ii) What we need:
  a) 3 or 4 cameras(what kind of camera). 
  b) body detect package
  3) *Raspberry Pi (TBD)
  


2. Robot(cart) to calculate the shortest route between two location

i) Description:
  When trying to figure the shortest route between two location, the map may not always do the work as it only provide normal routes without shortcuts. The idea is we put down the robot and it will find the shortest cut for you automatically. It will go automatically without repeating same route. After all, it will give you the shortest way.
  
ii) What we need:
  a) 
  b)
  c)
